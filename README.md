## Summary
### Advantages and Disadvantages of refactoring code
My approach to refactoring this code was to go after less nesting levels (do loops), reduce complexity in the conditional statements and reduce the line count.  Specific tasks included:
*  Reuse of much of the code written for the stock_analysis project in terms of the logic for determining how to track the volume, starting price and ending price for each ticker. 
* Reuse of code to make the report available for multiple years with a button.

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script
